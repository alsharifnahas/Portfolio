# Portfolio

## Description

This is a static porfolio website that contains my work. It also contains all of my social media and contact information in order to contact me.

The website is a static web page. HTML and CSS was used only, also bootstrap was used as framework.

**Note**: The latest commit to this repository had slight changes to the style.css and index.html files. The same layout was used, but the changes were in naming the classes and using semantic tags.

**Note**: This a link to the actual website: [Porfolio Website](https://alsharifnahas.github.io/Portfolio/.)
